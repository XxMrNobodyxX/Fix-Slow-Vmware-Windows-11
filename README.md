# Fix Slow VMware Windows 11  

Improve VMware performance on Windows 11 by disabling Virtualized Security.  

After struggling with slow VMs on VMware, I created a batch script that disables Virtualized Security, allowing VMs to run normally again.  

## What This Script Does  
‚úî Disables Virtualized Security on Windows 11  
‚úî Improves VMware VM performance  
‚úî Prevents unnecessary security features from slowing down your VM  


**Disables the Hyper-V hypervisor and all Hyper-V features to prevent conflicts with VMware:**
```
powershell.exe Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor
powershell.exe Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Microsoft-Hyper-V"
```

**Ensures the hypervisor is disabled at boot, preventing Hyper-V from interfering:**
```
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
```

**Completely removes all Hyper-V related features using DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management):**
```
dism /online /disable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-hyper-v-all
```

**Disables Virtual Secure Mode (VSM), which is part of Windows Defender Credential Guard:**
```
bcdedit /set vsmlaunchtype off
```

**Disables LSA (Local Security Authority) Isolation and Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) to prevent performance degradation:**
```
bcdedit /set '{0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215}' loadoptions DISABLE-LSA-ISO,DISABLE-VBS
```

**Runs the Device Guard Readiness Tool to disable Device Guard and Credential Guard:**
```
powershell.exe C:\dgreadiness_v3.6\dgreadiness_v3.6\DG_Readiness_Tool_v3.6.ps1 -Disable
```

**Disables power throttling for VMware Workstation, ensuring full CPU performance:**
```
powercfg /powerthrottling disable /path "C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\x64\vmware-vmx.exe"
```

## Download Requirements  

You'll need to download the **Device Guard and Credential Guard hardware readiness tool** from either this repository or Microsoft:  

**[Microsoft Download Link](https://download.microsoft.com/download/B/D/8/BD821B1F-05F2-4A7E-AA03-DF6C4F687B07/dgreadiness_v3.6.zip)**

## How to Use  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Extract the `dg_readiness` tool** from the ZIP file.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Modify the path** in the `.bat` file to point to the extracted location.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the `.bat` file as Administrator** (ignore errors if any).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Restart your machine** when prompted.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Check `Systeminfo` ‚Äì Virtualized Security should now be disabled.

## Important Notes  

- **This script must be re-run after every Windows update** or whenever Windows re-enables Virtualized Security.  
- Once disabled, the **Side Channel Mitigation** option will no longer appear in VMware settings.  
- Running this script will not harm your system, but ensure you understand its effects before use.
